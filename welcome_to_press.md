# Welcome to Press
Press is a *wysiwyg* writer for crafting notes. It uses markdown for styling and formatting text with a beautiful inline preview. If you’re new to markdown, check out the next note for tips and tricks.

Press is currently only available on Android as a proof-of-concept, but the plan is to introduce it to macOS and iOS in the near future using Kotlin Multiplatform. If you’d like to contribute, Press is hosted on Github:
